<p>The magnetic poles are crucial for human life as they protect Earth from harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays by deflecting charged particles from the sun through the planet's magnetic field. This protection helps prevent increased rates of cancer and other health issues that could arise from higher radiation levels. The moon, on the other hand, plays a vital role in stabilizing Earth's axial tilt, which maintains a relatively stable climate over long periods. This stability is essential for the continuity of seasons and the overall climate patterns that support agriculture and ecosystems vital for human survival. Additionally, the moon's gravitational pull generates ocean tides, which are important for marine life, coastal ecosystems, and human activities such as fishing and navigation.</p><ImageHover/>
