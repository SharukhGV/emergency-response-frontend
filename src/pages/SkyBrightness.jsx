        Here are five descriptions of sky brightness affected by light pollution, categorized by a percent, along with approximate descriptions of how many stars you might see under total darkness:
</div>
<strong><div style={{backgroundColor:"black", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">0-10% Light Pollution:</div></strong>
<div style={{backgroundColor:"black", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">・:*˚:✧｡・:*˚:✧｡・:*˚:✧｡</div>
<div  style={{backgroundColor:"black", color:"white"}}  className="skydescription">Sky Description: In areas with minimal light pollution, the sky appears exceptionally dark. The Milky Way is vividly visible, and thousands of stars are discernible.
Approximate Star Visibility: Around 2,500 to 3,000 stars visible to the naked eye.</div>
<strong><div style={{backgroundColor:"black", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">10-30% Light Pollution:</div></strong>
<div style={{backgroundColor:"black", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">・*˚✧｡・*˚✧｡・*˚✧｡</div>

<div style={{backgroundColor:"black", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">Sky Description: Light pollution begins to affect the visibility of fainter stars, causing a visible glow near the horizon. However, major constellations and the Milky Way's core are still relatively clear.
Approximate Star Visibility: Roughly 1,000 to 2,000 stars visible to the naked eye.</div>
<strong><div className="skydescription" style={{backgroundColor:"rgba(58, 55, 50, 100)", color:"white"}} >30-50% Light Pollution:</div></strong>
<div className="skydescription" style={{backgroundColor:"rgba(58, 55, 50, 100)", color:"white"}} >｡ ✧ ｡ ✧｡</div>

<div style={{backgroundColor:"rgba(58, 55, 50, 100)", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">Sky Description: Moderate light pollution dims the view of the Milky Way and fainter stars. Only the brightest stars and major constellations are easily identifiable.
Approximate Star Visibility: Around 500 to 1,000 stars visible to the naked eye.</div>
<strong><div  style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(85, 72, 43)", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">50-70% Light Pollution:</div></strong>
<div style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(85, 72, 43)", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">✧</div>

<div  style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(85, 72, 43)", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">Sky Description: Substantial light pollution obscures most of the Milky Way and dimmer stars, leaving only the brightest stars and planets visible. The sky appears significantly brightened, even at night.
Approximate Star Visibility: Approximately 100 to 500 stars visible to the naked eye.</div>
<strong><div style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(119, 85, 10)", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">70-100% Light Pollution:</div></strong>

<div style={{backgroundColor:"rgb(119, 85, 10)", color:"white"}} className="skydescription">Sky Description: Heavily affected by light pollution, the sky is illuminated, making it challenging to distinguish individual stars or constellations. Only the very brightest celestial objects, such as the Moon, planets, and a few prominent stars, are visible.
Approximate Star Visibility: Less than 100 stars visible to the naked eye, often limited to the brightest stars and planets.</div>

<p>Please note that these descriptions and star visibility counts can vary based on factors such as atmospheric conditions, time of year, and specific locations within each light pollution category.</p>
